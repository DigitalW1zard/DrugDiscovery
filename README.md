# DrugDiscovery
A Python code snippet for a drug discovery program that involves the following stages: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and validation techniques. The focus here is to guide through the structure of such a program.
Key Steps in the Program:

    Data Preprocessing: Cleans the dataset, handles missing values, and splits features (X) and targets (y).
    Feature Engineering: Standardizes the data and applies feature selection to retain the most informative features.
    Model Selection: Implements a RandomForestClassifier and tunes hyperparameters using grid search.
    Validation: Evaluates the model with accuracy, ROC-AUC, and classification metrics.

You can adapt this program further to include domain-specific features, such as molecular fingerprints, QSAR modeling, or integration with cheminformatics libraries like RDKit.
